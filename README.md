## Overview

Welcome to the Machine Learning Algorithms Playground repository by DeepScripts! This repository contains Jupyter notebooks covering various machine learning algorithms implemented using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn.

## Algorithms Covered

1. **Linear Regression**:
   - [Notebook](https://github.com/DeepScripts/Machine-Learning/blob/main/linear%20regression.ipynb)
   - Description: Linear regression is a basic and commonly used type of predictive analysis that examines the linear relationship between two variables.


2. **Logistic Regression**:
   - [Notebook](logistic_regression.ipynb)
   - Description: Logistic regression is used for classification tasks, where the dependent variable is categorical.

3. **Polynomial Regression**:
   - [Notebook](polynomial_regression.ipynb)
   - Description: Polynomial regression is a form of linear regression in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial.

4. **Decision Trees**:
   - [Notebook](Decision_tree.ipynb)
   - Description: Decision trees are a popular method for classification and regression tasks. They create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.

5. **Random Forest Classifier**:
   - [Notebook](Random_Forest_classifier.ipynb)
   - Description: Random forests are an ensemble learning method used for classification and regression. They operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

6. **Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC)**:
   - [Notebook](HAC_Agglomerative_clustering.ipynb)
   - [Dendrogram Notebook](HAC_dendrogram.ipynb)
   - Description: HAC is a method of cluster analysis that builds a hierarchy of clusters. The HAC algorithm starts with each point as its cluster and then merges the closest pairs of clusters until all points are in a single cluster.

7. **DBSCAN for Clustering**:
   - [Notebook](dbscan_for_clustering.ipynb)
   - Description: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) is a clustering algorithm that groups together points that are closely packed together, marking as outliers points that lie alone in low-density regions.
